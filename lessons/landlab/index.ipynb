    "   * The example is the erosional degradation of an earthquake fault scarp, and which evolves over time in response to the gradual downhill motion of soil. \n",
    "   * Here we use a simple \"geomorphic diffusion\" model for landform evolution, in which the downhill flow of soil is assumed to be proportional to the (downhill) gradient of the land surface multiplied by a transport coefficient.\n",
